## Contributing

Be sure to create your own fork of this repository, utilize the separation of major features into individual branches, and create Pull Requests when major features have been implemented. Before creating a pull request, or continuing from your last coding session, be sure to pull any changes from the upstream. If you are unsure of what this would look like to get set up, here is a quick guide:

1. fork this repository using the button underneath your profile picture
2. clone your fork to your machine locally
3. navigate to the clones root directory and add the upstream reference to this repository using the following command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/weatherdb/weatherdb.git`
4. you can now update your fork with changes merged to this repository! Here's a simple example:

```bash
git commit -m "i did some work, here's my meaningful commit message"
git pull upstream <CURRENT_BRANCH>

# uh oh, conflicts...
# few min later, conflicts resolved

git commit -m "fixed conflicts from updating branch"
git push origin <CURRENT_BRANCH>

# after the feature is complete, toss a PR over to this repo
```

## Installation

Ensure [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) are properly installed and configured. Clone the forked repository, create .env files based on the .env.examples, and run the following commands:

```bash
cd weatherdb
yarn
yarn install:all
yarn dev
```

`yarn` will install the top level dependencies, and `yarn install:all` will install both backend and frontend dependencies. `yarn dev` will run in development mode.

## Production

To run a production build of this application, You must build the react application and serve it from the server. Assuming you have already gone through the installation process outlined above, run the following commands:

```bash
yarn build
yarn serve
```

`yarn build` will package the react app into a bundle at `frontend/build` and `yarn serve` will start the node server in production mode, which will serve the application routes.
